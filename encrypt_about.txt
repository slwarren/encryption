Encryption is a process by which information (text, numbers, or whole files) is encoded so that it is unreadable or not understandable to the average person. For example, in a caesar cipher (a form of text encryption) the letters in the alphabet are shifted by a set number, so that A may become F, B becomes G, and so on. Only those who know the key can decrypt the text and read it. The caesar cipher is so old and simple that it's fairly easy to decode (if you know that the cipher has been used), but simple ciphers like it were the building blocks for modern file encryption, which uses more complex algorithms to hide file content and ensure privacy. Most file transfer or file storage platforms use some form of encryption so that users' files can't be used by strangers if the database or connection is tampered with, but no form of encryption is entirely fool-proof.
